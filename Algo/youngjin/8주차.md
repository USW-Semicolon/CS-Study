## [141. Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)
**Level: Easy**

### 📝 Problem

Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

### 💡 Examples

**Example 1:**
```text
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

**Example 2:**
```text
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

**Example 3:**
```text
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

### ✅ Constraints
- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 10^4].
- -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
- pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.

### ✅ Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def hasCycle(self, head):
        slow = head
        fast = head

        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

            if slow == fast:
                return True

        return False 
```

### 🔁 시도 과정

#### 마지막 시도 (정답)
```python
class Solution(object):
    def hasCycle(self, head):
        slow = head
        fast = head

        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next         # 한 칸 이동
            fast = fast.next.next    # 두 칸 이동

            if slow == fast:
                return True          # 두 포인터가 만나면 사이클 존재

        return False 
```

### 📌 설명
- 같은 노드에서 만나면 → 사이클 있음 (True)
- 끝까지 가도 안 만나면 → 사이클 없음 (False)
